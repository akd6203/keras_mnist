# Image Classification Using Neural Networks

## Introduction

This project is a practical demonstration of image classification using neural networks. Image classification plays a crucial role in computer vision, and this project specifically focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning. The code is implemented in Python using the Keras library, built on top of TensorFlow.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `image_classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the image classification project.
- `README.md`: This README file that provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code.

## Dependencies

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (2.x recommended)
- Keras (usually included with TensorFlow)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Opencv

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
